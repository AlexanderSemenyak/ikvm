# Jessie Lesbian's IKVM.NET fork (aka Jessie Lesbian's cute-looking .NET-based Java Virtual Machine)

## List of changes Jessie Lesbian made

 + Mono fork of IKVM.reflect
 + Prebuilt classpath
 + Easy to use build script
 + Official builds

## List of things Jessie Lesbian want to do

 + Add JDK tools like javac, javah, javap, etc...
 + Play Minecraft with this IKVM.NET fork

## Build

step 1: extract the repository

step 2: add your MSVC and .NET toolchains to your path environmental variable

step 3: run build.bat

NOTE: The built-in NANT tool may not work if you extract using windows explorer's built-in ZIP extractor due to some stupid security measures. You may need to unblock the archive in properties or extract using 7-zip.

If you hate building or can't build, don't worry, you will still experience the Java Virtual Machine made in C#. The cute-looking Jessie Lesbian had built all of this herself just in case you don't want to or can't build.
