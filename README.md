## Build

step 1: extract the repository

step 2: make sure that you have the Microsoft.NET SDKs installed

step 3: run build.bat

NOTE: The built-in NANT tool may not work if you extract using windows explorer's built-in ZIP extractor due to some stupid security measures. You may need to unblock the archive in properties or extract using 7-zip.

If you hate building or can't build, don't worry, you will still experience the Java Virtual Machine made in C#. The cute-looking Jessie Lesbian had built all of this herself just in case you don't want to or can't build.

## About OpenJDK.NET: The OpenJDK port for Microsoft.NET made by Jessie Lesbian

OpenJDK.NET is an OpenJDK port for Microsoft.NET made by Jessie Lesbian. It contains 6 JDK tools: javac, javah, javap, jar, native2ascii, and rmic. It is currently an experimental feature and may not work.

OpenJDK.NET enables IKVM to be used as a drop-in Java Development Kit. It is shipped with all Jessie Lesbian IKVM releases except the first one.
