# Jessie Lesbian IKVM

## Build

step 1: extract the repositority

step 2: add your MSVC and .NET toolchains to your path enviromental variable

step 3: run build.bat

NOTE: The buit-in NANT tool may not work if you extract using windows explorer's buit-in ZIP extractor due to some stupiud security measures. You may need to unblock the archive in properties or extract using 7-zip.

If you hate building or can't build, don't worry, you will still expirience the Java Virtual Machine made in C#, the cute-looking Jessie Lesbian had built all of this herself.
